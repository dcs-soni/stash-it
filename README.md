## How It Works üîç
Stash It leverages **ChromaDB** for efficient storage and retrieval of content. When you add content, it is transformed into embeddings using advanced AI models. These embeddings allow for quick and accurate vector searches, making it easy to find relevant information based on your queries.

### Embeddings
Embeddings are numerical representations of your content that capture its semantic meaning. By converting your text into embeddings, Stash It can perform similarity searches, allowing you to find related content quickly.

### Vector Search
Using ChromaDB, Stash It enables vector search capabilities. When you search for content, the application retrieves the most relevant results based on the embeddings, ensuring you get the best matches for your queries.

## Getting Started üöÄ
To get started with Stash It, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stash-it.git
   cd stash-it
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - For root folder:
     ```bash
     npm install

     ```
   - For the client:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, Chroma host and port:
   ```plaintext
